Using a grouped aggregate query to uncover the total revenue generated per film rating (PG-13, R, G, etc)

SELECT f.rating AS film_rating,
SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM payment p
JOIN rental r ON p.rental_id = r.rental_id
JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id
GROUP BY f.rating
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
