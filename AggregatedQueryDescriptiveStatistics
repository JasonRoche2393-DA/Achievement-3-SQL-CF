I used SQL to calculate descriptive statistics for both the film table and the customer table through aggregated queries.

RENTAL DURATION - QUERY:
SELECT--rental duration
AVG(rental_duration) AS average_rental_duration,
MIN(rental_duration) AS minimum_rental_duration,
MAX(rental_duration) AS maximum_rental_duration,
COUNT(rental_duration) AS count_rental_duration
FROM film

RELEASE YEAR - QUERY:
SELECT
    AVG(release_year) AS average_release_year,
    MIN(release_year) AS minimum_release_year,
    MAX(release_year) AS maximum_release_year,
    COUNT(release_year) AS count_release_year
FROM film;

RENTAL RATE - QUERY:
SELECT
    AVG(rental_rate) AS average_rental_rate,
    MIN(rental_rate) AS minimum_rental_rate,
    MAX(rental_rate) AS maximum_rental_rate,
    COUNT(rental_rate) AS count_rental_rate
FROM film;

LENGTH - QUERY:
SELECT
    AVG(length) AS average_length,
    MIN(length) AS minimum_length,
    MAX(length) AS maximum_length,
    COUNT(length) AS count_length
FROM film;

REPLACEMENT COST - QUERY:
SELECT
    AVG(replacement_cost) AS average_replacement_cost,
    MIN(replacement_cost) AS minimum_replacement_cost,
    MAX(replacement_cost) AS maximum_replacement_cost,
    COUNT(replacement_cost) AS count_replacement_cost
FROM film;
